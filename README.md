## Summary
I will write a multi-threaded program, in Java, that implements the well-known Dining Philosophers problem. This particular problem is often used to demonstrate the use of mutual exclusion algorithms and deadlock prevention in multi-threaded applications.
The scenario is that there are some number N of oriental philosophers sitting around a round table (for our implementation we will use N=5). Each philosopher has one chopstick at his right hand and one chopstick at his left hand. However, the right hand chopstick for philosopher n is the left hand chopstick for philosopher (n+1) mod N. In other words, there are N chopsticks for N philosophers (one between each pair of philosophers).
